At work, I once needed to create 9 HTML creative files for Email Marketing on a day, all manually. After that, I decided to create a software that could create those HTML files for me, taking as input sliced images (HTML files made up of images at 100%). Additionally, also replacing manual work, this software imports all content (generated HTML creative and slided images) onto FTP (predetermined choices to pick up from). This software reduced up to 5 times the amount of time I needed for the manual job. The higher the number of sliced images, the more special it becomes as an aid to reduce manual work since more and more HTML tables (and inner tables) are created automatically. 

The library jsoup (https://jsoup.org/) was used for handling HTML with Java.

FINAL NOTE: 

I intentially left comments and unused classes in the final software. This is my very first software published on Github, and for my own future reference, I left those content there to check how I started programming in Java.
